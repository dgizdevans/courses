# Final Project ‚Äì Introduction to Big Data with Spark and Hadoop

This notebook is the final project for the course **Introduction to Big Data with Spark and Hadoop**, 
which is part of the **IBM Data Engineering Professional Certificate** on Coursera.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates:
- Loading structured data from CSV files
- Performing exploratory data analysis using **Pandas**
- Calculating key metrics such as sales and profit
- Creating visualizations using **matplotlib** and **seaborn**
